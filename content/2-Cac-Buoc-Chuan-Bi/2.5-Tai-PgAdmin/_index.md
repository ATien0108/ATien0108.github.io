## Overview

**PgAdmin** is a graphical user interface (GUI) tool for managing **PostgreSQL** databases. It allows developers to:

- Create and manage databases.
- Run SQL queries directly.
- View table structures, relationships, and actual data.

In this project, **PgAdmin** is used as a support tool for monitoring and interacting with the data during development. It is especially helpful when working with **Prisma ORM** and **seed data**.
